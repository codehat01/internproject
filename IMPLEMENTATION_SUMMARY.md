# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Copyright Updates
- **Landing.tsx**: Changed footer from "© 2025 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs - All Rights Reserved" to "@carapace 2025"
- **Login.tsx**: Changed footer from "GOVERNMENT OF INDIA • © 2025" to "@carapace 2025"

### 2. Gmail Signup Flow (Login.tsx)
- Added Gmail-only signup functionality with email validation
- Only allows email addresses ending with @gmail.com
- Includes password confirmation field
- Minimum password length of 8 characters enforced
- Automatically creates user profile with default values:
  - Role: 'staff'
  - Badge number: Generated as `GMAIL-{timestamp}`
  - Department: 'General'
  - Rank: 'Officer'
- Toggle between login and signup views with "Sign up with Gmail" button
- Existing badge-based login remains intact

### 3. Geofence Management (GeofenceManagementView.tsx)
- Made embedded maps fully responsive:
  - Grid layout uses `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 400px), 1fr))` for responsive columns
  - Map height set to `min(500px, 60vh)` to prevent overflow on mobile
  - Added `maxWidth: '100%'` to ensure maps never exceed container width
- Component is now uncommented and fully functional
- Users can create, edit, view, and deactivate multiple geofences
- Each geofence defined by polygon boundaries and metadata (station ID, name, radius)

### 4. Punch Workflow Overhaul (AttendanceView.tsx)
- **Removed Shift Management**:
  - Hidden all shift-related UI (Current Shift card, Upcoming Shift card)
  - Removed shift validation logic for punch in/out
  - Removed grace period displays

- **New Toggle-Based Punch System**:
  - First click: Punch In (button shows green with "Punched In" text)
  - Second click: Punch Out (button shows red with "Punched Out" text)
  - Button state persists across page reloads by checking today's last punch
  - No shift restrictions - users can punch at any time

- **Geofence Integration**:
  - On each punch, user's location is checked against all active geofences
  - Stores geofence validation result (`is_within_geofence` boolean) with attendance record
  - Displays "Inside station" or "Outside station" status in:
    - Punch confirmation dialog
    - Attendance history table (Location column)

- **Simplified Attendance Rules**:
  - If user punches in at least once on a day → marked **Present**
  - If user never punches in on a day → marked **Absent**
  - Removed late/early status calculations
  - Hours worked still calculated from punch in/out pairs

- **Updated Instructions**:
  - Removed shift-related instructions
  - Added geofence status information
  - Simplified to focus on toggle behavior

### 5. Punch Confirmation Dialog (PunchConfirmationDialog.tsx)
- Added `geofenceStatus` prop
- Displays geofence status badge showing "Inside station" or "Outside station"
- Badge styled with appropriate colors:
  - Green background for "Inside station"
  - Yellow background for "Outside station"

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Requirements
The implementation assumes the `attendance` table has:
- `is_within_geofence` (boolean) - stores whether punch was inside any geofence
- `geofence_id` (uuid, nullable) - reference to the geofence if inside one

### Geofence Logic
- Multiple geofences can exist in the database
- When user punches, system checks if location falls inside ANY active geofence
- Validation supports both:
  - Polygon boundaries (point-in-polygon algorithm)
  - Circular boundaries (radius-based distance calculation)

### State Management
- Punch state (`isPunchedIn`) determined by querying today's latest attendance record
- If last punch type is "in" → button shows "Punched In" (green)
- If last punch type is "out" or no punches → button shows "Punched Out" (navy/golden)
- State synchronized on:
  - Component mount
  - After successful punch
  - Location refresh
